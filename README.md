The performance of electronica by Disc Jockys (DJs) 
presents a unique opportunity to develop interactions between performer and music. Through recent research in 
the MIR field, new tools for expanding DJ performance 
are emerging. The use of spectral, loudness, and temporal 
descriptors for the classification of electronica is explored. Our research also introduces the use of a multitouch interface to drive a performance-oriented DJ application utilizing the feature set. Furthermore, we present 
that a multi-touch surface provides an extensible and collaborative interface for browsing and manipulating MIRrelated data in real time.
